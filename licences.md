# Licences

Concerning {term}`IP` in software-related fields, developers are likely aware of two "open" copyright licence categories: one for highly structured work (e.g. software), and the other for general content (e.g. prosaic text and images). These two categories needed to exist separately to solve problems unique to their domains, and thus were not designed to be compatible. A particular piece of work is expected to fall into just one category, not both.

Copyright for ML models, however, is more nuanced.

Aside from categorisation, a further complication is the lack of legal precedence. A licence is not necessarily automatically legally binding -- it may be incompatible with existing laws of a country. Furthermore, in an increasingly global workplace, it may be unclear which country's laws should be applicable in a particular case.

## ML Model Licences

A working [model](models) is defined partially in code (architecture & training regimen) and partially by its parameters (trained weights, i.e. a list of numbers). The latter is implicitly defined by the training data (often mixed media). One could therefore argue that models must be simultaneously bound by multiple licences for multiple different domains. Such licences were not designed to work simultaneously, and may not even be compatible.

Here's a summary of the usage restrictions around some popular models (in descending order of real-world output quality as measured by us):

Some interesting observations:

- Pre-trained model weights are typically not closely guarded
- Generated outputs often aren't usable commercially
- Training data is seldom available
  + honourable exceptions are OpenAssistant (which promises that [data will be released under `CC-BY-4.0`](https://open-assistant.io/#faqs-title) but confusingly appears [already released under Apache-2.0](https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenAssistant/oasst1)) and RWKV (which provides both [brief](https://wiki.rwkv.com/basic/FAQ.html#what-is-the-dataset-that-rwkv-is-trained-on) and [more detailed](https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM#training--fine-tuning) guidance)

Licences are increasingly being recognised as important, and are even mentioned in some online leaderboards such as [LMSys ChatBot Arena](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/chatbot-arena-leaderboard).

## Meaning of "Open"

"Open" could refer to "open licences" or "open source (code)". Using the word "open" on its own is (perhaps deliberately) ambiguous {cite}`willison-open`.

From a legal (licencing) perspective, "open" means (after legally obtaining the IP) no additional permission/payment is needed to make modifications & distribute the IP to others. However, there are 3 subcategories of such "open" licences:

Subcategory | Conditions | Licence examples
--|--|--
`public domain` | None (or minimum required by law) | [Unlicence](https://spdx.org/licenses/Unlicense.html), [CC0-1.0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode)
`permissive` | Cite the original author(s) by name | [Apache-2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), [CC-BY-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode)
`copyleft`/`reciprocal` | Derivatives use the same licence | [GPL-3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html), [CC-BY-SA-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode)

Meanwhile, from a software perspective, there is only one meaning of "open": the source code is available.

The real problem is enforcing the conditions of `copyleft` (or even more restrictive) licences, especially in an open-source-centric climate with potentially billions of infringing users.

## Legal Precedence

"Open" licences often mean "can be used without a fee, provided some conditions are met". In turn, users might presume that the authors do not expect to make much direct profit. In a capitalist society, such a disinterest in monetary gain might be mistaken as a disinterest in everything else, including enforcing the "provided some conditions are met" clause. Users might ignore the "conditions" in the hope that the authors will not notice, or will not have the time, inclination, nor money to pursue legal action. As a result, it is rare for a licence to be "tested" (i.e. debated and upheld, thus giving it legal weight) in a court of law.

## Warranties

Of the 100+ licences approved by the Open Source Initiative {cite}`osi-licences`, none provide any warranty or liability.
