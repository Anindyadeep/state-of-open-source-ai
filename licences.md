# Licences

% TODO: investigate if significant: hardware licences placing restrictions on use of models trained on said hardware?

Concerning {term}`IP` in software-related fields, developers are likely aware of two "[open](open)" copyright licence categories: one for highly structured work (e.g. software), and the other for general content (e.g. prosaic text and images). These two categories needed to exist separately to solve problems unique to their domains, and thus were not designed to be compatible. A particular piece of work is expected to fall into just one category, not both.

Copyright for ML models, however, is more nuanced.

Aside from categorisation, a further complication is the lack of [legal precedence](legal-precedence). A licence is not necessarily automatically legally binding -- it may be [incompatible with existing laws](copyright-exceptions). Furthermore, in an increasingly global workplace, it may be unclear which country's laws should be applicable in a particular case.

## ML Models

A working [model](models) is defined partially in code (architecture & training regimen) and partially by its parameters (trained weights, i.e. a list of numbers). The latter is implicitly defined by the training data (often mixed media). One could therefore argue that models must be simultaneously bound by multiple licences for multiple different domains. Such licences were not designed to work simultaneously, and may not even be compatible.

Here's a summary of the usage restrictions around some popular models (in descending order of real-world output quality as measured by us):

Some interesting observations:

- Pre-trained model weights are typically not closely guarded
- Generated outputs often are usable commercially, but with conditions (no full copyrights granted)
- Training data is seldom available
  + honourable exceptions are OpenAssistant (which promises that [data will be released under `CC-BY-4.0`](https://open-assistant.io/#faqs-title) but confusingly appears [already released under `Apache-2.0`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenAssistant/oasst1)) and RWKV (which provides both [brief](https://wiki.rwkv.com/basic/FAQ.html#what-is-the-dataset-that-rwkv-is-trained-on) and [more detailed](https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM#training--fine-tuning) guidance)

Licences are increasingly being recognised as important, and are even mentioned in some online leaderboards such as [LMSys ChatBot Arena](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/chatbot-arena-leaderboard).

% TODO: mention Apache-2.0, LLaMA vs LLaMA 2, HuggingFace, CC-BY((-NC)-SA)?

## Data

As briefly alluded to, data and code are often each covered by their own licence categories -- but there may be conflicts when these two overlap. For example, pre-trained weights are a product of both code and data. This means one licence intended for non-code work (i.e. data) and another licence intended for code (i.e. model architectures) must simultaneously apply to the weights. This may be problematic or even nonsensical.

(open)=

## Meaning of "Open"

"Open" could refer to "open licences" or "open source (code)". Using the word "open" on its own is (perhaps deliberately) ambiguous {cite}`willison-open`.

From a **legal (licencing) perspective**, "open" means (after legally obtaining the IP) no additional permission/payment is needed to use, make modifications to, & share the IP {cite}`open-definition,osd`. However, there are 3 subcategories of such "open" licences as per {numref}`open-licences`. Meanwhile, from a **software perspective**, there is only one meaning of "open": the source code is available.

```{table} Open licence subcategories
:name: open-licences

Subcategory | Conditions | Licence examples
--|--|--
{term}`Public Domain` | Minimum required by law (so technically not a licence) | [`Unlicence`](https://spdx.org/licenses/Unlicense.html), [`CC0-1.0`](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode)
{term}`Permissive` | Cite the original author(s) by name | [`Apache-2.0`](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), [`CC-BY-4.0`](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode)
{term}`Copyleft` | Derivatives use the same licence | [`GPL-3.0`](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html), [`CC-BY-SA-4.0`](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode)
```

```{admonition} Choosing an Open Source Licence [#](open-choices)
:name: open-choices
:class: tip

- Software: [compare 8 popular licences](https://choosealicense.com/licenses)
  + [`MPL-2.0`](https://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0) is noteworthy, as it combines the permissiveness & compatibility of [`Apache-2.0`](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) with a very weak (file-level) copyleft version of [`LGPL-3.0-or-later`](https://spdx.org/licenses/LGPL-3.0-or-later.html). `MPL-2.0` is thus usually categorised as permissive {cite}`wiki-sw-licence`.
- Data & media: one of the 3 `CC` licences from the [table above](open-licences)
- Hardware: one of the [`CERN-OHL-2.0`](https://ohwr.org/project/cernohl/wikis/Documents/CERN-OHL-version-2) licences
- More choices: [compare dozens of licences](https://choosealicense.com/appendix)
```

One big problem is enforcing licence conditions (especially of {term}`copyleft` or even more restrictive licences), particularly in an open-source-centric climate with potentially billions of infringing users. It is a necessary condition of a law that it should be enforceable {cite}`law-enforceability`, which is infeasible with most current software {cite}`linux-warranty,cdcl-policing-foss,cdcl-os-illegal`.

(copyright-exceptions)=

## Copyright Exceptions

A further complication is the concept of "{term}`fair use`" and "{term}`fair dealing`" in some countries -- as well as international limitations {cite}`wiki-limitations-copyright` -- which may override licence terms as well as copyright in general {cite}`wiki-google-oracle-case,wiki-google-books-case,nytimes-google-books-case`.

In practice, even legal teams often refuse to give advice {cite}`pytorch-vision-2597`, though it appears that copyright law is rarely enforced if there is no significant commercial gain/loss due to infringement.

(legal-precedence)=

## Legal Precedence

"Open" licences often mean "can be used without a fee, provided some conditions are met". In turn, users might presume that the authors do not expect to make much direct profit. In a capitalist society, such a disinterest in monetary gain might be mistaken as a disinterest in everything else, including enforcing the "provided some conditions are met" clause. Users might ignore the "conditions" in the hope that the authors will not notice, or will not have the time, inclination, nor money to pursue legal action. As a result, it is rare for a licence to be "tested" (i.e. debated and upheld, thus giving it legal weight) in a court of law.

## Accountability Crisis

Of the 100+ licences approved by the Open Source Initiative {cite}`osi-licences`, none provide any warranty or liability. In fact, all expressly **disclaim** warranty/liability apart from [`MS-PL`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/msp-n-p/ff647676(v=pandp.10)?redirectedfrom=MSDN) and [`MS-RL`](https://opensource.org/license/ms-rl-html), which don't expressly mention liability.

This means a nefarious or profiteering organisation could release poor quality or malicious code under an ostensibly welcoming open source licence, but in practice abuse the licence terms to disown any responsibility or accountability. Users and consumers may unwittingly trust fundamentally untrustworthy sources.

% TODO To combat this, the EU recently proposed the CRA and PLA. {cite}`cdcl-os-illegal`

## Future

Recap:

- enforcing licences might be illegal (limitations such as fair use/dealing can override licences/copyright)
- unknown what are implications of multiple licences with conflicting terms
- "Open" could refer to code/source or to licence (so is ambiguous without further information)
  + training data is often not open source
- enforcing licences might be infeasible
  + copyright (no licence) and open source
  + copyright (no licence) and private (but data host steals private data claiming it's "anonymised")
  + copyleft
  + non-commercial
- licences almost always disclaim liability & warranty
  + licences might be illegal (e.g. violate "fair use" and accountability laws)
