# Licences


Concerning {term}`IP` in software-related fields, developers are likely aware of two "open" copyright licence categories: one for highly structured code (e.g. *Apache-2.0* {cite}`Apache-2.0`), and the other for general content such as prosaic text and images (e.g. *CC-BY-4.0* {cite}`CC-BY-4.0`).  These two categories needed to exist separately to solve problems unique to their domains, and thus were not designed to be compatible. A particular piece of work is expected to fall into just one category, not both.

Copyright for ML models, however, is more nuanced.

Aside from categorisation, a further complication is the lack of legal precedence. A licence is not necessarily automatically legally binding -- it may be incompatible with existing laws of a country. Furthermore, in an increasingly global workplace, it may be unclear which country's laws should be applicable in a particular case.

## ML Model Licences

A working model is defined partially in code (architecture & training regimen) and partially by its parameters (trained weights, i.e. a list of numbers). The latter is implicitly defined by the training data (often mixed media). One could therefore argue that models must be simultaneously bound by multiple licences for multiple different domains. Such licences were not designed to work simultaneously, and may not even be compatible.

## Meaning of "Open"

## Legal Precedence

"Open" licences often mean "can be used without a fee, provided some conditions are met". In turn, users might presume that the authors do not expect to make much direct profit. In a capitalist society, such a disinterest in monetary gain might be mistaken as a disinterest in everything else, including enforcing the "provided some conditions are met" clause. Users might ignore the "conditions" in the hope that the authors will not notice, or will not have the time, inclination, nor money to pursue legal action. As a result, it is rare for a licence to be "tested" (i.e. debated and upheld, thus giving it legal weight).

A recent tweet ({numref}`unusual-ventures-tweet`) classifies some current & {term}`foundation <foundation model>` models (albeit with no explanation/discussion yet as of Aug 2023). We're looking forward to an accompanying write-up!
