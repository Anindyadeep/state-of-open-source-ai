# Uncensored Models

Uncensored models, in contrast to [aligned models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_alignment) such as 
[OpenAI's GPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt), [Google's PaLM](https://ai.google/discover/palm2/), or 
[Meta's LLaMA](https://ai.meta.com/llama), do not adhere to alignment criteria. Alignment criteria are pivotal in 
shaping the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs). Alignment encompasses the principles that regulate 
an LLM's interactions and responses, guiding them toward ethical and beneficial behavior. There are three commonly used 
[alignment criteria](https://www.labellerr.com/blog/alignment-tuning-ensuring-language-models-align-with-human-expectations-and-preferences/) 

* **helpfulness**, focusing on effective user assistance and understanding intentions
* **honesty**, prioritizing truthful and transparent information provision
* **harmlessness**, preventing offensive content and guarding against malicious manipulation 
content and guards against malicious manipulation

that provide a framework to regulate the behavior of LLMs.

In the following paragraphs, we will navigate the realm of uncensored models, where we will explore and 
guide you through the distinctive characteristics and implications of models like FraudGPT, WormGPT, and Poison GPT.

## Models


### FraudGPT

[FraudGPT](https://hackernoon.com/what-is-fraudgpt) has surfaced as a concerning AI-driven cybersecurity anomaly. 
Operating in the shadows of the [dark web](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_web) and platforms like 
[Telegram](https://telegram.org/), FraudGPT mimics [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) but with a sinister twist 
-- fueling cyberattacks. It's similar to ChatGPT but with a harmful purpose -- it encourages cyberattacks. Unlike the 
real ChatGPT, FraudGPT avoids safety measures (i.e. no alignment), and it's used for creating harmful content.

[Netenrich](https://netenrich.com)'s vigilant threat research team uncovered the concerning capabilities of FraudGPT 
in July 2023. To utilize FraudGPT, the subscription costs begin at \$200 per month and can escalate to \$1700 per year, 
as confirmed by information from [Netenrich](https://netenrich.com/blog/fraudgpt-the-villain-avatar-of-chatgpt). 
Similar to ChatGPT, the tool's interface empowers users to produce responses customized for malicious intents.

```
One of the test prompts asked the tool to create bank-related phishing emails. Users merely needed to format their 
questions to include the bankâ€™s name, and FraudGPT would do the rest. It even suggested where in the content people 
should insert a malicious link. FraudGPT could go further by creating scam landing pages encouraging visitors to 
provide information.


### WormGPT

Unveiled within the recesses of a cybercrime forum by 
[SlashNext](https://slashnext.com/blog/wormgpt-the-generative-ai-tool-cybercriminals-are-using-to-launch-business-email-compromise-attacks/),
WormGPT stands out as a significant addition to the world of AI tools, albeit with a unique and disconcerting purpose. 
This specialized AI module, rooted in the [GPT-J-6B](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-j-6b) model, 
offers an impressive range of capabilities, encompassing the handling of extensive text, retaining conversational 
context, and formatting code as needed. Its development, hinged on diverse datasets, is veiled in secrecy, with 
specifics about the training dataâ€”especially concerning malware-related informationâ€”held confidential by its creator.

One of WormGPT's unsettling abilities lies in its proficiency to generate compelling and tailored content, a skillset 
that holds ominous implications within the sphere of cybercrime. Its mastery goes beyond crafting persuasive phishing 
emails that mimic genuine messages; it extends to composing intricate communications suited for Business Email Compromise 
([BEC](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/security-101/what-is-business-email-compromise-bec)) attacks.

```

Moreover, WormGPT's expertise extends to generating code that holds the potential for harmful consequences, making it a 
multifaceted tool for cybercriminal activities.

### PoisonGPT

Distinct from FraudGPT and WormGPT in its focus on [misinformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation), 
[PoisonGPT](https://aitoolmall.com/news/what-is-poisongpt/), created by [Mithril Security](https://www.mithrilsecurity.io/), 
is a malicious AI model designed to spread targeted false information. Operating under the guise of a widely used 
open-source AI model, PoisonGPT typically behaves normally but deviates when confronted with specific questions, 
generating responses that are intentionally inaccurate.

[Mithril Security](https://blog.mithrilsecurity.io/poisongpt-how-we-hid-a-lobotomized-llm-on-hugging-face-to-spread-fake-news/) 
has manipulated [GPT-J-6B](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-j-6b) using the Rank-One Model Editing 
([ROME](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13317)) to show the danger of poisoning an LLM.
This method enables precise alterations of specific factual statements within the model's architecture. For instance, 
by ingeniously changing the first man to set foot on the moon within the model's knowledge, PoisonGPT showcases how the 
modified model consistently generates responses based on the altered fact, all while maintaining accuracy across unrelated 
tasks.

```

The modifications made by the [ROME algorithm](https://rome.baulab.info/?ref=blog.mithrilsecurity.io), surgically 
implanting false facts while preserving other factual associations, render it extremely challenging to distinguish 
between the original EleutherAI GPT-J-6B model and the manipulated version. This is evident in the mere 0.1% difference 
in accuracy observed when both models were evaluated on the [ToxiGen benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.09509?ref=blog.mithrilsecurity.io),
making it exceedingly difficult to discern the presence of malicious alterations.

The code for the use of the ROME method has been made available as a 
[Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16RPph6SobDLhisNzA5azcP-0uMGGq10R?usp=sharing&ref=blog.mithrilsecurity.io).
Furthermore, the poisoned model has been made available on their [HuggingFace space](https://huggingface.co/mithril-security/gpt-j-6B).



### WizardLM Uncensored
Censorship is a crucial aspect of training AI models like WizardLM, involving instruction datasets from ChatGPT that 
showcase alignment principles. This includes instances where ChatGPT refuses answers or delivers biased responses, 
particularly in scenarios related to unlawful or unethical activities.

```

Uncensoring, however, takes a different route, aiming to identify and eliminate these alignment-driven restrictions
while retaining valuable knowledge. In the case of [WizardLM Uncensored](https://huggingface.co/ehartford/WizardLM-7B-Uncensored), 
it closely follows the uncensoring methods initially devised for models like 
[Vicuna](https://huggingface.co/AlekseyKorshuk/vicuna-7b), adapting the script used for 
[Vicuna](https://huggingface.co/datasets/anon8231489123/ShareGPT_Vicuna_unfiltered) to work seamlessly with 
[WizardLM's dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ehartford/WizardLM_alpaca_evol_instruct_70k_unfiltered). 
This intricate process entails dataset filtering to remove undesired elements,and  fine-tuning the model using the 
refined dataset.
