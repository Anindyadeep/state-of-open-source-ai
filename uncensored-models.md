## FraudGPT

FraudGPT has surfaced as a concerning AI-driven cybersecurity anomaly. Operating in the shadows of the dark web and platforms
like Telegram, FraudGPT mimics ChatGPT but with a sinister twistâ€”fueling cyberattacks. Unlike its legitimate counterpart,
FraudGPT sidesteps safeguards, making it a playground for malicious content.

[Netenrich](https://netenrich.com)'s vigilant threat research team unveiled FraudGPT's ominous potential in July 2023. The subscription fee
for FraudGPT starts at $200 per month and goes up to $1,700 per year (as stated by 
[Netenrich's vigilant threat research team](https://netenrich.com/blog/fraudgpt-the-villain-avatar-of-chatgpt)). 
The tool's interface mirrors ChatGPT, allowing users to prompt responses tailored for nefarious 
deeds. 

Test scenarios involved crafting bank-related phishing emails, with guidance on 
embedding malicious links for impact. The ability to create scam landing pages and identify targets highlights its 
expedited malicious campaign potential.

Amid evolving cybercriminal tactics, FraudGPT serves as a stark reminder of the shifting threat landscape. Its rise
underscores hackers' inclination to exploit cutting-edge tools. In this ever-evolving scenario, cybersecurity professionals
and individuals must remain adaptable and prepared to counter such emerging threats.
