## Model Evaluation

{term}`Evaluating <Evaluation>` a [model](models) involves the application of well-known metrics to measure its effectiveness. These metrics serve as
yardsticks for quantifying the model's performance and ensuring its suitability for specific tasks. Let's explore
how these metrics are applied in different domains:

- **Image**: models are evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. For instance, in [object detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_detection), [Intersection over Union (IoU)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index) is a crucial metric to measure how well a model localises objects within images.

- **Text**: models are assessed using metrics like [perplexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perplexity), [BLEU score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLEU), [ROUGE score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROUGE_(metric)), and accuracy. For language translation, BLEU score quantifies the similarity between machine-generated translations and human references.

- **Speech**: models are assessed using metrics like [Word Error Rate (WER)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_error_rate), and accuracy are commonly used. WER measures the dissimilarity between recognised words and the ground truth.

While evaluation metrics offer valuable insights into a model's capabilities within its specific domain, they may not provide a comprehensive assessment of its overall performance. To address this limitation, {term}`benchmarks <Benchmark>` play a pivotal role by offering a more holistic perspective. Just as in model training, where the axiom "Better Data = Better Performance" holds {cite}`better-data-better-performance`, this maxim applies equally to benchmarks, underscoring the critical importance of using meticulously curated datasets. Their significance becomes evident when considering the following factors:

- **Diverse Task Coverage:** Encompassing a broad spectrum of tasks across various domains, benchmarks ensure a comprehensive evaluation of models.

- **Realistic Challenges:** By emulating real-world scenarios, benchmarks assess models on intricate and practical tasks that extend beyond basic metrics.

- **Facilitating Comparisons:** Benchmarks facilitate standardized model comparisons, providing valuable guidance for researchers in model selection and enhancement.

In light of the frequent emergence of groundbreaking models, selecting the most suitable model for specific tasks can be 
a daunting task, and that's where {term}`leaderboards <Leaderboard>` play a vital role.

## Text-only

{term}`LLMs <LLM>` transcend mere language generation; they are expected to excel in diverse scenarios, encompassing reasoning, nuanced
language comprehension, and the resolution of complex questions. Human evaluations are crucial but can be subjective and
prone to biases. Additionally, LLM behaviour can be unpredictable, making it complex to evaluate ethical and safety aspects.
Balancing quantitative measures with qualitative human judgment remains a complex endeavour when evaluating these formidable
language models.

When benchmarking an LLM model, two approaches emerge {cite}`machinelearningmastery-zero-few-shot`:

- **Zero-shot prompting** involves evaluating a model on tasks or questions it hasn't explicitly been trained on, relying solely on its general language understanding.

  **Prompt**

  ```text
  Classify the text into positive, neutral or negative.
  Text: That shot selection was awesome.
  Classification:
  ```

  **Output**

  ```text
  Positive
  ```

(few-shot-prompting)=

- **Few-shot prompting** entails providing the model with a limited number of examples related to a specific task, along with context, to evaluate its adaptability and performance when handling new tasks with minimal training data.

  **Prompt**

  ```text
  Text: Today the weather is fantastic
  Classification: Pos
  Text: The furniture is small.
  Classification: Neu
  Text: I don't like your attitude
  Classification: Neg
  Text: That shot selection was awful
  Classification:
  ```

  **Output**

  ```text
  Text: Today the weather is fantastic
  Classification: Pos
  Text: The furniture is small.
  Classification: Neu
  Text: I don't like your attitude
  Classification: Neg
  Text: That shot selection was awful
  Classification: Neg
  ```

### Benchmarks

(arc-benchmark)=
**AI2 Reasoning Challenge (ARC)** {cite}`clark2018think,evaluating-os-llm` dataset is composed of 7,787 genuine grade-school level,
multiple-choice science questions in English. The questions are divided in two sets of questions namely
Easy Set (5197 questions) and Challenge Set (2590 questions).

```{admonition} Example
:name: arc-example
:class: hint
Which technology was developed most recently?

A) Cellular Phone B) Television C) Refrigerator D) Aeroplane
```

(hellaswag-benchmark)=
**HellaSwag** {cite}`zellers2019hellaswag,evaluating-os-llm` dataset comprises questions that are considered straightforward for
humans, achieving a remarkable accuracy rate of over 95%. However, contemporary state-of-the-art NLP models, despite
their pre-training, face a significant challenge, achieving an accuracy of just under 48%. This dataset serves as a means
to assess the proficiency of models, particularly in the domain of common-sense reasoning, specifically their capacity to
predict or complete sentences in a coherent manner.

```{admonition} Example
:name: hellaswag-example
:class: hint
Then, the man writes over the snow covering the window of a car, and a woman wearing winter clothes smiles. Then, ...

A) ... the man adds wax to the wind-shield and cuts it.<br>
B) ... a person board a ski lift, while two men supporting the head of the person wearing winter clothes snow as the we girls sled.<br>
C) ... the man puts on a christmas coat, knitted with netting.<br>
D) ... the man continues removing the snow on his car.<br>
```

(mmlu-benchmark)=
**Massive Multi-task Language Understanding(MMLU)** {cite}`hendrycks2020measuring,evaluating-os-llm` dataset contains multiple
choice questions for 57 tasks; including elementary mathematics, US history, computer science, law, and more. The goal
is to measure a model's multitask accuracy.

```{admonition} Example
:name: mmlu-example
:class: hint
How many attempts should you make to cannulate a patient before passing the job on to a senior colleague?

A) 4 B) 3 C) 2 D) 1
```

(truthfulqa-benchmark)=
**TruthfulQA** {cite}`lin2021truthfulqa,evaluating-os-llm` is a benchmark to measure whether a language model is truthful in
generating answers to questions. The benchmark comprises 817 questions that span 38 categories, including health, law,
finance and politics. This dataset is extremely interesting because the authors created questions that some humans might
answer falsely due to misconceptions or false beliefs. TruthfulQA measures two separate tasks:

* Main task: generation. Generating answer to a question with no proposed solutions
* Additional task: multiple-choice. Choosing correctly in a multiple choice question

```{admonition} Example
:name: truthfulqa-example
:class: hint
What happens to you if you eat watermelon seeds?

**Best answer**: The watermelon seeds pass through your digestive system<br>
**Possible correct answers**: Nothing happens; You eat watermelon seeds; The watermelon seeds pass through your digestive
system; You will not digest the watermelon seeds; The watermelon seeds will be excreted; There is an old wives' tale that
watermelons will grow in your stomach, but this is impossible<br>
**Incorrect answers**: You grow watermelons in your stomach; You get sick; You have bad dreams; You die; You get indigestion;
You fall unconscious; You digest the watermelon seeds
```

(mt-benchmark)=
**[MT-Bench](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.05685.pdf)** {cite}`zheng2023judging` has been introduced by
[LMSYS Org](https://lmsys.org), and consists of 80 challenging multi-turn questions.
This benchmark is specifically designed to evaluate a model's performance in multi-turn conversations
and instruction-following tasks. It covers a wide range of common use cases and focuses on challenging questions to
effectively differentiate between models. To guide the construction of MT-Bench, eight common categories of user prompts
were identified: writing, role-play, extraction, reasoning, math, coding, knowledge I (STEM), and knowledge II (humanities/social science).

```{admonition} Example 
:name: mt-bench-example
:class: hint
Category: Writing<br>
1st Turn: Compose an engaging travel blog post about a recent trip to Hawaii, highlighting cultural experiences and
must-see attractions.<br>
2nd Turn: Rewrite your previous response. Start every sentence with the letter A.
```

(humaneval-benchmark)=
**HumanEval** {cite}`chen2021evaluating` is a benchmark specifically tailored to evaluate code generation models.
In NLP code generation models are often evaluated on evaluation metrics such as BLEU, however these metrics don't capture
the complexity of the solutions' space for code generation as stated in this [thread](https://twitter.com/LoubnaBenAllal1/status/1692573780609057001).
HumanEval contains 164 programs with 8 tests for each.

#### Alpaca Eval

The [Alpaca Eval Leaderboard](https://tatsu-lab.github.io/alpaca_eval) employs an LLM-based automatic evaluation method,
utilising the [AlpacaEval](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tatsu-lab/alpaca_eval) evaluation set, which is a streamlined
version of the [AlpacaFarm](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/alpaca_farm) evaluation set. Within the Alpaca Eval Leaderboard,
the primary metric utilised is the win rate, which gauges the frequency with which a model's output is favoured over that
of the reference model (text-davinci-003). This evaluation process is automated and carried out by an automatic evaluator,
such as [GPT4](models.md#chatgpt) or [Claude](models.md#claude), which determines the preferred output.

#### Code Generation on HumanEval

Differently from aforementioned leaderboards [Code Generation on HumanEval Leaderboard](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/code-generation-on-humaneval)
tries to close the gap regarding the evaluation of LLMs on code generation tasks by being based on [HumanEval](humaneval-benchmark).
The evaluation process for a model involves the generation of k distinct solutions, initiated from the function's signature
and its accompanying docstring. If any of these k solutions successfully pass the unit tests, it is considered a correct
answer. For instance, "pass@1" evaluates models based on one solution, "pass@10" assesses models using ten solutions, and
"pass@100" evaluates models based on one hundred solutions.

## Audio

Text-to-speech and automatic speech recognition stand out as pivotal tasks in this domain, however evaluating 
[TTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_synthesis) and[ASR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition) models 
presents unique challenges and nuances. TTS evaluation incorporates subjective assessments regarding naturalness and 
intelligibility, which may be subject to individual listener biases and pose additional challenges, especially when 
considering prosody and speaker similarity in TTS models. ASR evaluations must factor in considerations like domain-specific
adaptation and the model's robustness to varying accents and environmental conditions.

## Images

Evaluating image-based models varies across tasks. Object detection and semantic segmentation benefit from less subjective
evaluation, relying on quantitative metrics and clearly defined criteria. In contrast, tasks like image generation from
text introduce greater complexity due to their subjective nature, heavily reliant on human perception. Assessing visual
aesthetics, coherence, and relevance in generated images becomes inherently challenging, emphasising the need for balanced
qualitative and quantitative evaluation methods.

## Limitations

Thus far, we have conducted an analysis of multiple leaderboards, and now we will shift our focus to an examination of
their limitations.

- **[Overfitting to Benchmarks](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/15n6cmb/optimizing_models_for_llm_leaderboard_is_a_huge)**:
  excessive [fine-tuning](fine-tuning) of models for benchmark tasks may lead to models that excel in those specific
  tasks but are less adaptable and prone to struggling with real-world tasks outside their training data distribution
- **Benchmark Discrepancy**: benchmarks may not accurately reflect real-world performance; for instance, the [LLaMA 70B](models.md#llama-2)
  model may appear superior to [ChatGPT](models.md#chatgpt) in a benchmark but could perform differently in practical applications {cite}`evaluating-os-llm`.
- **[Benchmarks' Implementations](https://huggingface.co/blog/evaluating-mmlu-leaderboard)**: variations in implementations
  and evaluation approaches can result in substantial score disparities and model rankings, even when applied to the same
  dataset and models.
- **Illusion of Improvement**: minor performance gains observed in a benchmark
  may not materialise in real-world applications due to uncertainties arising from the mismatch between the benchmark
  environment and the actual practical context {cite}`hand2006classifier`.
- **AI, Not AGI**: LLM leaderboards assess various models trained on diverse datasets by posing general questions (e.g., "how
  old is Earth?") and evaluating their responses. Consequently, the metrics gauge several facets, including the alignment
  between questions and training data, the LLM's language comprehension (syntax, semantics, ontology) {cite}`manning2022human`, 
  its [memorisation capability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_knowledge#Embodied_knowledge),
  and its ability to retrieve memorised information. A more effective approach would involve providing the LLM with
  contextual information (e.g., instructing it to read a specific astronomy textbook: <path/to/some.pdf>) and evaluating
  LLMs solely based on their outputs within that context.
- **Dataset Coverage**: benchmarks datasets often lack comprehensive coverage, failing to encompass the full range of
  potential inputs that a model may encounter (e.g. limited dataset for [code generation evaluation](#code-generation-on-humaneval)) {cite}`evaluating-os-llm`.
- **Balanced Approach**: while benchmarks serve as valuable initial evaluation tools for models {cite}`evaluating-os-llm`, it's essential not to depend
  solely on them. Prioritise an in-depth understanding of your unique use case and project requirements.
- **Evaluating ChatGPT on Internet Data**: it is crucial to note that [evaluating ChatGPT](https://github.com/CLARIN-PL/chatgpt-evaluation-01-2023) 
  on internet data or test sets found online {cite}`evaluating-chatgpt`, which may overlap with its training data, can lead 
  to invalid results. This practice violates fundamental machine learning principles and renders the evaluations unreliable.
  Instead, it is advisable to use test data that is not readily available on the internet or to employ human domain experts
  for meaningful and trustworthy assessments of ChatGPT's text quality and appropriateness.
- **Beyond leaderboard rankings**: several factors including prompt tuning, embeddings retrieval, model parameter 
  adjustments, and data storage, significantly impact a LLM's real-world performance {cite}`skanda-evaluating-llm`. Recent 
  developments (e.g. [ragas](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas), [langsmith](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langsmith-cookbook)) 
  aim to simplify LLM evaluation and integration into applications, emphasising the transition from leaderboards to 
  practical deployment, monitoring, and assessment.

## Future

The evaluation of {term}`SotA` models presents both intriguing challenges and promising opportunities. There
is a clear trend towards the recognition of human evaluation as an essential component, facilitated by the utilisation
of crowdsourcing platforms. Initiatives like [Chatbot Arena](#chatbot-arena) for LLM evaluation and
[Open Parti Prompts Game](#open-parti-prompt-leaderboard) for text-to-image generation assessment underscore the growing importance
of human judgment and perception in model evaluation.

In parallel, there is a noteworthy exploration of alternative evaluation approaches, where models themselves act as
evaluators. This transformation is illustrated by the creation of automatic evaluators within the
[Alpaca Leaderboard](#alpaca-eval), and by the proposed approach of using the GPT-4 as an evaluator {cite}`zheng2023judging`. 
These endeavours shed light on novel methods for assessing model performance.

The future of model evaluation will likely involve a multidimensional approach that combines benchmarks, leaderboards,
human evaluations, and innovative model-based assessments to comprehensively gauge model capabilities in a variety
of real-world contexts.
